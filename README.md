# WeatherSearch
build a weather app using API integration & delpoy to netlify https://vanilla-weathersearch.netlify.app/

This interactive weather app was created using the OpenWeatherMap API giving you real-life data and forecasts for any location around the world. Find your city with the search function or simply use your current location with a single click. It will show the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and provide you with a six-day forecast. Change the location to see different comments matching the weather forecast of your inserted city. 

This weather app was created with Vanilla JS as part of the 8-week SheCodes Plus Workshop.
